# Zihan Zhao's Master Thesis Repository

This repository contains files related to my master thesis, which focuses on analyzing Spotify user data to identify user personas and key factors influencing premium membership conversion.

## Datasets

Two datasets are available in this repository:

1. **Spotify_data**: Sourced from Kaggle, this dataset offers a broad perspective on user interactions and behaviors on Spotify. It provides a foundation for understanding general user trends and patterns.

2. **Spotify_data2**: Collected via a Google Form survey, this dataset is the primary dataset collected specifically for this thesis. It contains user demographics, behavior, membership status, and other relevant information. This dataset is crucial for in-depth analysis and modeling.

## Analysis and Modeling

The analytical processes, including data cleaning, preprocessing, and logistic regression modeling, are documented in the Jupyter Notebook file named `Thesis_coding_final.ipynb`. This notebook contains Python code along with detailed comments explaining each step to ensure clarity and reproducibility. It serves as a comprehensive guide to the data analysis and modeling techniques employed in this thesis.

## Thesis Document

The final thesis document is available in PDF format, named `MA_Thesis_Zhao(rewrite).pdf`. This document synthesizes the research findings, offering insights into user personas, key factors influencing premium membership conversion, and strategic recommendations for Spotify. It provides a comprehensive overview of the research objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions.
